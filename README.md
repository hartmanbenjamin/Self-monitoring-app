# Self-monitoring application documentation
1. Setting up the app

To set up the app (assuming you have [deno](https://deno.land/) installed) all you have to do is open the folder containing the app with a terminal in a linux environment and type the commmand:

        deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --unstable app.js

Now the app is running locally and you can access it either via a browser by visiting localhost:7777 or via a terminal window by using the curl command. 
2. Using the application

Using the application requires that you create an acocunt and sign in. This can be done by clicking the 'Register' button on the login screen.
